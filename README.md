# Telecom-Churn-Analysis

This project explores customer churn in the telecom industry by analyzing patterns, identifying key factors associated with churn, and building predictive models to help mitigate it. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model evaluation.

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to:
- Analyze factors contributing to customer churn.
- Build predictive models to help identify customers at risk of churning.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations for reducing churn rates.

## Data Description
The dataset contains various features related to customersâ€™ demographics, account information, and service usage patterns, including:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Demographics**: Includes information like gender, age, and income.
- **Account Information**: Such as contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
- **Service Details**: Services the customer is subscribed to, like internet, phone, and streaming.

## Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into patterns and correlations between features and customer churn.
3. **Modeling**: Training and evaluating machine learning models to predict churn.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, actionable recommendations are provided to reduce churn rates.

## Getting Started
